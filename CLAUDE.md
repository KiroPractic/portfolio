# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
Pure HTML static portfolio site with a Matter.js-powered dark mode toggle.

## Development
- Run locally: Open index.html in a browser
- Live reload: Use `npx live-server` or similar tool

## Code Style
- HTML: 2-space indentation, semantic elements
- CSS: BEM naming convention, mobile-first approach
- JS: 2-space indentation, camelCase variables, const by default
- Inline scripts should be moved to script.js when substantial

## Best Practices
- Keep HTML semantic
- Use CSS for styling and animations when possible
- Maintain responsive design
- Prefer vanilla JS over frameworks for this small project
- Document complex physics simulations with comments
